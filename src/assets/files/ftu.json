    "description": "Teamed up with two other students, we explored various deep learning based methods for segmenting out functional tissue units (FTU) from histological stainings in five different tissues.\n \nMy personal contribution was building an in-house U-Net model based on the original U-Net architecture. After just 20 epochs, the U-Net models learned patterns of the ground truth masks.",
