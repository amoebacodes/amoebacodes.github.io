    "description": "I picked up full-stack development on the fly during my 12-week internship. Under the guidance of my mentor Shane Baskin, I built a web interface and integrated in automation hardwares (the OpenTrons liquid handler). The web serves as a hub for all actions and information related to cancer drug screening experiments. It allows automation technicians to\n  \n- start the next round of experiments, which under the hood, uses an active learning algorithm to automatically generate the most promising cancer cell line and compound combinations to be tested\n  \n- review algorithm-recommended cell line and compound combinations\n  \n- review location of reagent stocks on the liquid handler decks\n  \n- remotely execute liquid handler scripts\n  \n- review experiment results on interactive graphs\n  \n- do so in a step-wise fashion",
