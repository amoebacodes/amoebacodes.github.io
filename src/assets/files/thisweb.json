    "description": "I utilized the skills I gained during my summer internship (full-stack development) to create my own website in Angular. Being a amateur artist, I had a lot of fun channeling into my artistic side while gaining front-end development skills. I enjoyed learning animations, experimenting with colors, and designing the components in a user-friendly fashion.",
