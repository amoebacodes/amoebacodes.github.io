    "description": "This project aims to 1) identify epigenetic regions that associate with evolution of different social group sizes in primates; 2) investigate its implications in schizophrenia. Predicted open chromatin level of each region that are present in the ATAC-seq data is kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Pfenning. \n \nMy personal contribution was to have accomplished task one. The top epigenetic regions that are associate with evolution are identified through determining the magnitude of the slope of the linear regression line fitted through a sociability vs predicted open chromatin level plot for each region. We also learned to use Pittsburgh Supercomputer in the course.",
