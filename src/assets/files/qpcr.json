    "description": "In a team of four, we realized a closed-loop experiment, where not only the execution but the selection of the experiments as well are done by robots. Here we define an experiment as a unique combination of qPCR parameters, including primer CG-content, amplification length, magnesium concentration, etc. We implemented an active learning algorithm that would, in the first round, randomly select a batch of experiments, and in each subsequent round, select batches of experiments that are the most informative. This 'informativeness' is equivalently prediction uncertainty: the more uncertain, the more informative. We used the CyBio liquid handler, Momentum scheduling software, and QuantStudio qPCR machine to automate the execution of the experiment. \n \nMy personal contribution includes researching and selecting the parameters that can vary, collaboratively writing the script for the active learning algorithm, the liquid handler, and the scheduling software, and manual preparation of stock solutions (qPCR cocktail). \n \nFor more detailed methods and results, please review the README in the source code link.",
