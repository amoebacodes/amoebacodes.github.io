    "description": "In a team of four, we realized a closed-loop experiment, automating selection and execution of the experiments. An experiment is a unique combination of qPCR parameters, such as amplification length and magnesium concentration. Automated selection is done by an active learning algorithm. Automated execution is done by liquid handling and qPCR robots.\n \nMy personal contribution includes designing the experiment, writing scripts for the active learning algorithm, the liquid handler, and the scheduling software, and manual preparation of reagents.",
