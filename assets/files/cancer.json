    "description": "In a team of three, we each implemented one method to distinguish renal from adrenal pediatric cancer from transcriptome profiles. I used a feedforward multilayer perceptron to accomplish the task. All three methods are comparable, and all achieve F1 scores above 0.97. Through dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE, we also discovered a subtype of pediatric renal cancer.",
