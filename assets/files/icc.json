    "description": "Immunocytochemistry can be used as an indicator of potential protein interactions. Once stained with different fluorescent antibodies, a computer vision algorithm is applied to analyze the microscopy images and determine if two different proteins colocalize, i.e. have overlapping signals.\n \nI automated both immunocytochemistry and implemented the computer vision algorithm.",
