    "description": "I picked up full-stack development on the fly during my 12-week internship. Under the guidance of my mentor Shane Baskin, I built a web interface and integrated in automation hardwares (the OpenTrons liquid handler). The web serves as a hub for all actions and information related to cancer drug screening experiments. It allows automation technicians to\n    - start the next round of experiments, which under the hood, uses an active learning algorithm to automatically generate the most promising cancer cell line and compound combinations to be tested\n    - review algorithm-recommended cell line and compound combinations\n    - review location of reagent stocks on the liquid handler decks\n    - remotely execute liquid handler scripts\n    - review experiment results on interactive graphs\n    - do so in a step-wise fashion",
