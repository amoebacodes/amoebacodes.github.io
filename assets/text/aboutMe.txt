I am currently completing my final semester of my master's degree in Automated Science: Biological Experimentation at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), a program under the Computational Biology Department. I have been trained to understand and carry out a diverse set of automations in biological contexts: ranging from building machine learning and deep learning models to generate predictions or to segment images, to implementing active learning algorithms for selecting the most informative set of experiments to perform, to using robots to execute traditionally manual wet-lab experiments, to building web interface that integrates hardware and software automation. 

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in 2021 with two Bachelor's degrees in Molecular and Cellular Biology and Behavioral Biology.
